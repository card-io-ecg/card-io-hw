Card/IO hardware
================

Card/IO is an open source, single lead ECG in a business card-like format.

The project contains two PCB designs:
 
 - main_board: main/carrier board, which is a 4 layer PCB containing the MCU, display, battery and related circuitry
 - frontend: the ECG frontend, ADC, and touch detection/wakeup generator, implemented as a solder-on daughter board
